### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    I thoroughly enjoyed working on Lab 2, Part 1 because it was one of the first programs I had coded in C++. Learning Python in high school and having to learn a different coding language when entering university seemed very intimidating at the beginning of the year; looking back I could not have wished for a better transition. For this assignment, I admire how simple it was, yet how it helped build the foundation for everything I have coded after it up
    to my current projects.

  * Lab 4
    
    Unlike the second lab, Lab 4 Part 2 was something that I had coded entirely by myself because my partner and I had split our work up into parts. The creation of video games has always been fascinating to me, even if they were as simple as the High-Low game I had created. I love the idea of being able to have a program that is interactive with the user in a fun and lighthearted way, which is what makes this lab one of my favorites. Additionally, at the time of coding this we started implementing different statements such as "if-else" statements, etc.

  * Lab 9
  
    Lab 9, Part 2 was a bit challenging for my partner and I which is what I appreciate about it and I also enjoyed the prompt. I feel like the concept of this program(scheduling) can be applied to a variety of situations, so if it were not to be specific to the prompt, it could be used to make different tasks easier and increase efficiency. This assignment was also one of my favorites because of how it synthesized so many different statements to reach one goal.
